Create a folder MyComp in Components folder
Add a new Razor Component in the folder MyComp. Name it BtnComp.razor

Edit Home.razor to add BtnComp component.
We see that the output does not render the button click
Now add @rendermode="InteractiveServer" to the BtnComp
We can see that the button is interacting
Next we can give the component page wise rendermode also by adding @rendermode="InteractiveServer" at BtnComp page rather than the Home page/ BtnComp component.
